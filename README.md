# Intro

This is [rudo-thomas's](https://github.com/rudo-thomas) fork of
https://github.com/mlt/schwinn810 (look for the original README there).

My motivation was to use `cp210x` "proxy" DLL `SiUSBXp.dll` to learn about how
to talk to a particular device.

My "master" branch has the following:
1. the upstream "master" +
1. upstread "dev" (merged up to tag `0.3rc1`) +
1. essential fixes from my "cp210x-fixes" branch (pull to be requested)
1. further development for my use case (trivialities, really)
